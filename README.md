# Weather app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run the application

- Run `npm start` to run the react app.
- Run `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000` to run the json server on another port.

## Used packages

- react-router-dom to switch between pages
- uuid to generate unique ids
- json-server for a fake API for the database

## Used APIs

- ip-api to get the user's ip adress and get their current location
- aerisweather1 to get the weather at a location "city, country"

## TODO

- add style and use MUI
- JS to TS
- add error messages
- put requests in a file (better app architecture ?)
